How to run i3-server:
--------------------

1) To run an i3 server:
   -------------------
Note that i3_server is in the i3_server directory.

  $ i3_server chord_conf_file port_number

where
  - port_number represents the port number on which the i3_server
    is listening
  - cord_conf_file represents the configuration file for Chord
    and contains the following lines
    
    line 1:     chord_port chord_id
    lines 2..n: other_chord_IP_address:other_chord_port
    
    The first line contains the port and the 160 byte ID of the chord
    process associated with the i3_server.

    Each of the following lines contains info about an existing
    Chord node; in particular it contains the IP address, port number
    of *another* Chord node.

EXAMPLE: assume that you want to run two i3_servers on the same machine
with IP address 128.32.100.105. Then you can run 

  $ i3_server conf.0 10000
  $ i3_server conf.1 10001

where

  $  more conf.0
  6500 335989a257749e851378c5ed260bc0db077517f5
  128.32.100.205:6501
  $ more conf.1
  6501 308eae00f00c90824a67367dc0bf1f1833be9d47
  128.32.100.105:6500

Note that the port number of the Chord node associated to the first i3
server is 6500, the port number of the Chord node associated with the
second i3 server is 6500, and each Chord node points to the other
node.


2) Auto-generating configuration files:
   -----------------------------------

  (A) To generating the configuration files, go to chord/ directory and:

  $ gen_conf i3_srv_list.txt directory

where
  - i3_srv_list.txt is a file containing the list of nodes where you
    want to run i3, one per line.
  - path is the directory where all conf files will be dumped

  $ cat i3_srv_list.txt
  planetlab-1.cs.princeton.edu
  planetlab1.millennium.berkeley.edu
  planetlab1.ucsd.edu
  planetlab1.cs.uiuc.edu
  planetlab1.lcs.mit.edu

All the configuration files for i3 servers would have file name of the
form _<IP>_<i3-port>_<chord_port>.cfg and so batch scripting it should
be easy.

  (B) For the special case of running multiple i3 servers on a single
machine, the Chord configuration files can be automatically generated
with gen_conf in the chord directory.

  $ gen_conf_same n

where
  n is the number of servers you wish to run.

This generates files conf.0, conf.1, ..., conf.(n-1).  Each server
is assigned a random ID.  The IP addresses in the files are the same as
the IP address of the machine gen_conf is run on, so run it on the same
machine you plan to run the servers on.
