/// \brief Mechanism for accepting TCP connections.
///
/// Accepting a TCP connection consists of two pieces:
///
///   1. Setting up a TCP socket and marking it for listen: This is
/// handled by the Acceptor.
///
///   2.  Once a connection is received, "doing something" with it:
/// This is handled by the IAcceptorOwner.
///

///
/// \class IAcceptorOwner
/// Abstract class defines the interface that must be implemented by an
/// owner of an acceptor object.
///

class IAcceptorOwner {
public:
    virtual ~IAcceptorOwner() { };

    ///
    /// Callback that will be invoked whenever a new connection is
    /// received.  The callback is expected to create a continuation
    /// and return that as the result.
    /// @param conn A smart pointer that encapsulates the connection
    /// that was received.  @see NetConnectionPtr
    /// 
    virtual KfsCallbackObj *CreateKfsCallbackObj(NetConnectionPtr &conn) = 0;

/// \class Acceptor
/// A continuation for receiving connections on a TCP port.  Calls
/// back the associated IAcceptorOwner whenever a connection is received.
