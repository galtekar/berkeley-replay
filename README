   Berkeley Deterministic Replay (BDR) Release 0.1

WHAT IS BDR?
   BDR is a general-purpose deterministic replay tool (also known
   as record/replay) for reproducing executions of parallel (i.e.,
   multi-core) and distributed programs (i.e., those that communicate
   over a network). BDR enables users to analyze replay distributed
   executions with heavy instrumentation (e.g., distributed taint-flow)
   that would be too expensive in production environments.

   BDR should not be distributed for public use at this time as it is
   currently a research prototype. See the accompanying LICENSE file
   for more details.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
   BDR was designed for the x86 architecture, and in particular, the
   Pentium IV (or AMD equivalent) and newer models. The machine must
   have an MMU and performance counters.

   Processors that support long mode (64-bit mode), PAE (Physical Address
   Extensions), and PSE (Page Size Extension) features are supported,
   but they must be disabled for BDR to work. Future support for these
   features is planned.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
   BDR was designed to run on Linux 2.6 and is known to work with kernel
   versions 2.6.26 and greater.  Only 32-bit Linux is currently supported,
   but 64-bit Linux may be supported in the future. Any distribution of
   Linux (e.g., Debain, Fedora, etc.) will do.

   Compiling BDR requires a working GCC (>= 4.2) installation and Python
   2, version >= 6. Python 3 is not currently supported.

COMPILING BDR:
   - Do a "make clean", then a "make".

INSTALLING BDR:
   - Do a "make install". This will create a directory in build/ that
   will contain all the files you will need to record and replay BDR
   recordings on a node. This directory needs to be copied to the remote
   nodes doing the recording.

   - A "make dist" produces a tarball of the installation directory, to
   ease distribution.

RUNNING BDR:
   - First, we need to setup your environment.  Add the installation directory
   (see above) to your PATH.

   - Then to record, do "bdr-record /bin/my_fancy_distributed_program".
   The recording will be saved by default to a local directory (see the
   output of bdr-record to determine where).

   - To replay all recordings in a directory, do "bdr-replay
   file:/tmp/bdr-galtekar/recordings/*".
