TODO:
- Add scanner reaper to RangeServer
- CommitLog garbage collection
- Add Phantom updates
- Implement InMemory access groups
- Add logic to prevent root METADATA range from splitting
- Add DropTable command to RangeServer
- Memory Throttling
- Add global (timeout, workers, reactors, etc.) to config file 
- Make sure the crate table/modify schema cannot overflow a byte on column IDs.
- Re-write schema parser using Boost Spirit instead of expat (removes a dependency)
- Refactor so that schema can get updated on change (overhaul TableInfo)
- Make sure byte order swapping for timestamp happens properly on all architectures
- Make the Serialization routines work for all architectures
- Add range merging
- CommitLog reader should sanity check each block header
- CommitLogReader should be able to throw errors
- Clean up generate_test_data (have it generate timestamps formatted propertly and modify LoadDataSource to consume it).

DONE:
- Add destroy_scanner method to RangeServer
- clientTimestamp value does not appear to be used in RangeServer::update
- Fix timestamp issue.  In RangeServer::update the updateTimestamp is obtained
  from the commit log, but the splitStartTime is obtain from the updates and
  they are compared against one another (updateTimestamp > splitStartTime)
- Range constructor should throw exceptions
- Put root METADATA tablet Files metadata in hyperspace ( /hypertable/root )
- Add compression to commit log
- Get rid of directly written 'packed' commit log header in favor of a serialized one
- Add lzo block compressor
- Got rid of m_blocksize in CellStoreV0 and just use the one in m_trailer
- Fix bus error when you issue the following select statement after an initial load:
  select * from Test1 where row >= 'n' && row < 'm';
- Add DELETE to Hql
- Add delete_row, delete_cell, etc. to Mutator
- Add support for different compression schemes with args
- Figure out a solution to the problem of an update timing out
- Add regression for HQL
- Add comma separating the column families in the ACCESS GROUP clause
- Add support for TSV files
- Add header to load data infile format to specify with or without timestamps
- Add compression ratio field in CellStoreV0 trailer
- Figure out get_timestamp stuff (see Merge scanner) is it less than, less than or equal to???
- Make sure ':' character cannot be specified in column family name
- Clean up timestamp clause in SELECT
- Add INSERT command to Hql
- Add blocksize attribute to AccessGroup schema and hook it up with CellStore
- Fix excessive seek problem during major/merging compaction (added CellStoreScannerV0 readahead)
- Improve get_split_keys in Range class
- Get METADATA range split working
- Make sure updates are sent sorted in ascending order of timestamp (for same row)
- Add PAUSE command to hypertable (to facilitate testing)
- Get scan time interval working
- Add auto-assigned timestamps
- Change RangeServer::update to do a single write to the commit log instead of
  once for every range being updated.

DELETE from [table name] where row = 'row-key' [&& column = 'column-key'] [&& timestamp = 'timestamp'];
