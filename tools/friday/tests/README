Test programs
===============
simple: a simple C program that makes system calls in a loop
cplusplus: a simple C++ program that makes system calls in a loop
fork: a multi-process extension of the simple program
shared: an extension of the simple program that uses mmap()/BSD shared memory
threads: creates specified number of threads and makes each thread call a system call
cond: tests whether condition variables work across processes (they don't on Linux). This test isn't meant to be run with liblog/libreplay.
gethostbyname: tests the gethostbyname() library call wrapper
sysv: tests system V IPC shared memory (very similar to shared)
procs_and_threads: multiple processes, each with multiple threads
sendto: tests the sendto() socket call

Scripts
========
run_tests: run all of the above tests in log mode, and then in replay
mode, and then compares the output, and if it's not identical, signals
a problem.
