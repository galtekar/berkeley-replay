* Made this sucker more fault-tolerant: abrupt client disconnects are
handled gracefully by simple terminating the client thread after printing
out a brief error message.

* We now support logging to shared memory as well as through sockets.
An abrupt client crash results in shared memory contents flushed to disk.

* The logger binary in now called loggerbin. It has been wrapper by a Perl
script called logger, which performs cleanup after the logger is finished.

* The logger now simply dumps logs segments to disk in binary form. The
log2xml utility can be used to convert those binary files to XML.
