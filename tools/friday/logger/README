loggerbin:
	Multithreaded log server. Turn it on, leave it on. 

	How does it work? It waits for a connection, spawns a worker thread which
	handles log requests, and when finally it receives a log closed request, it
	closes the connection and terminates the thread. Up to MAX_NUM_PROCS
	concurrent connections are allowed.

	Right now, the server uses TCP. If you make any modifications, consider that
	the proc_table data structure is shared among the threads. Make sure you
	lock it to avoid race conditions!

log2xmlbin:
	Script that invokes loggerbin to convert .log files (outputted by the
	logger) to pseudo-XML format. libreplay expects the log file to be in 
	this pseudo-XML format.


logger.pl:
	Wrapper script for loggerbin. Ensures that all SysV shared memory
	segments are removed after loggerbin terminates.
