RealTime - Microseconds since the Epoch
LogicalTime - Increasng 64-bit "timestamp" supplied with updates

Log Replay
 - Range Server loads the CellStores for each range, recording the highest LogicalTime seen
 - Range Server will drop any phantom (e.g. log replay) updates that have a logical time that is <= highest LogicalTime of the CellStores




CellStores will store two timestamps:
  1. RealTime of when the compaction happened
  2. LogicalTime of last update
