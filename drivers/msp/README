Welcome to the Linux Memory Sharing Protocol (MSP) Driver.

Summary:
   This driver enables user-mode tasks executing on distinct CPUs/cores
   to share designated physical memory pages (or all user-addressable
   pages if one so desires) in accordance with a supported memory
   sharing protocol (MSP). The only supported MSP is the Concurrent-Read
   Exclusive-Write (CREW) protocol.

Credits:
   The implementation closely follows the shadow pagetable model described
   by Dunlap et al. in the SMP-ReVirt system (see Virtual Execution
   Environments (VEE) '08). The key difference is that SMP-ReVirt was
   implemented at the VMM level and was intended for whole-system memory
   sharing, while the Linux MSP driver is designed for user-level and
   task-specific memory sharing.

Limitations:
   o Only the CREW protocol is supported.
   o XXX: several others
