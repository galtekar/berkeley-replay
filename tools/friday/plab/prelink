# Options to pass to prelink
# -m	Try to conserve virtual memory by allowing overlapping
#	assigned virtual memory slots for libraries which
#	never appear together in one binary
# -R	Randomize virtual memory slot assignments for libraries.
#	This makes it slightly harder for various buffer overflow
#	attacks, since library addresses will be different on each
#	host using -R.

# How often should full prelink be run (in days)
# Normally, prelink will be run in quick mode, every
# $PRELINK_FULL_TIME_INTERVAL days it will be run
# in normal mode.  Comment it out if it should be run
# in normal mode always.
